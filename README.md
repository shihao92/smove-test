Sample app for starwars API integrations

To start the app

1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. Go to localhost:3000

Things to take note of
1. Google map is having bugs taking in params which are more than certain amount (might because no proper API key is being placed in yet)
2. There might be some bugs because this is coding in rush ( I'm still working on other projects at this moment so sorry about that ><" )

Enjoy!
